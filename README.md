## M3U Playlist Proxy

If none of these playlists work with your IPTV application, you can try using the [m3u-playlist-proxy](https://github.com/dtankdempse/m3u-playlist-proxy). This proxy acts as a middle layer to help resolve potential issues with playing the playlists, especially if your IPTV app doesn't support setting the required headers.

## Usage Instructions:

1. Choose the playlist format that suits your application or media player.
2. Add the playlist URL to your IPTV application.
3. Ensure that your application supports the required settings, such as setting the required headers for streams to play.
